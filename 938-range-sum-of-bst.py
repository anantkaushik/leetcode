Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value 
between L and R (inclusive).
The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

Example 1:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32

Example 2:
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
 
Note:
The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.
