Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/leaf-similar-trees/

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.
Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.
Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

Note:
Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
